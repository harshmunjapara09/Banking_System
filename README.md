## Overview
Project Fractures is a comprehensive banking system simulation that allows users to perform various banking operations such as opening a bank account, withdrawing money, depositing money, closing an account, generating a passbook, and sending passbook details via email.

## Features

1. **Open Bank Account:** This feature allows users to open a new bank account. All necessary details are required to successfully open an account.

2. **Withdraw Money:** With this feature, users can withdraw money from their account. The system checks for sufficient balance before allowing the transaction to proceed.

3. **Deposit Money:** This feature enables users to deposit money into their account. The system updates the account balance immediately after the deposit.

4. **Close Account:** Users can close their account using this feature. All transactions must be settled and the account balance must be zero before an account can be closed.

5. **Generate Passbook:** This feature allows users to generate a passbook that records all their transactions. The passbook can be generated at any time and will include all transactions up to the point of generation.

6. **Send Passbook Detail via Email:** Users can have their passbook details sent to their email. This feature ensures that users can access their transaction history whenever they need it.
